# Deep Learning Challenge

## Write a Report on the Neural Network Model 
* Write an analysis that includes a title and multiple sections, labeled with headers and subheaders. Explain the purpose of this analysis.
* Format images in the report so that they display correction 
* Answer all 6 questions in the results section:
    - Data Preprocessing:
        - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
        - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
        - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
        - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
        - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
        - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
* Summarize the overall results of your model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
